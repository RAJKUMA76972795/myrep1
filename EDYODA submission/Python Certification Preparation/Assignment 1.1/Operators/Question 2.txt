1. Explain Arithmetic operators with example

Arithmetic Operators perform various arithmetic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, %modulus, exponent, etc. There are various methods for arithmetic calculation in Python, like you can use the eval function, declare variable & calculate, or call functions.

Example: For arithmetic operators, we will take a simple example of addition where we will add two-digit 4+5=9
